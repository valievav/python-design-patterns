Problem: **Too many possible combinations**

Solution: **Bridge Design Pattern -> escape complexity explosion or decouple interface from implementation**

- Cartesian product (set of all ordered possible pairs) - in other words matrix with all possible combinations
- A(a, b), B(c, d) -> matrix 2x2 =>  AxB {(a, c), (a, d), (b, c), (b, d)}
- in a way bridge is a stronger form of encapsulation
