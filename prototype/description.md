Problem: **Need to have copy of the same object with different state, attribute values etc.**

Solution: **Prototype Design Pattern -> creating deepcopy of an object**

- Make a deepcopy and customize it (new functionality, change state etc.)
- No need to create new object from scratch each time
- Prototype - partially or fully constructed object (deepcopy)
- Prototype Factory - if there's fixed number of prototypes, use factory to simplify copies construction
